## Project Description (100–200 words)
For this assignment I made a calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I then integrated it into my previously made personal portfolio. The calculator has a responsive layout with buttons and operators. It also has a screen that displays what is currently being typed. It has keyboard support so that computer users may type numbers and operators directly instead of using the buttons. I included some hover animations for the buttons to make it a little more unique. The design was inspired by both the iOS calculator and Android calculator design, using like colors and layout. The calculator has been integrated into my portfolio and is accessible from the projects tab.

## Challenges & How I Overcame Them
The biggest challenge I encounter was with the calculator, there were many bugs that I hadto debug. The integration of the calculator and other code snippets from assignment 3 made it weird because of all the code pieces that I had to change and make sure would work together. Making sure it was all integrated cleanly was harder than I expected. Through debugging, using google and AI, I was able to figure out what was going wrong and how to fix it.
